# HealthMonitor
A tool written in GO to monitor OWASP-OWTF tool.

## Setting up environment for development
To compile the project GO is needed to be installed on the machine. Follow up the [link](https://golang.org/doc/install) to have woking directory.

Now create a folder for GO projects and add it to $GOPATH. The directory structure should be as follows:
```
\$GOPATH
  \src
    \health_monitor
  \bin
```
The `health_monitor` must be in **src** folder. Currently do not use `go get` to fetch the project.
